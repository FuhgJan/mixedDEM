# The mixed deep energy method for resolving concentration features in finite strain hyperelasticity

  - Author: Jan N Fuhg
  - Organization: Cornell University

Here, we propose an extension to the Deep Energy Method (DEM)
to resolve stress concentrations for finite strain hyperelasticity[1]. The developed framework termed mixed
Deep Energy Method (mDEM) introduces stress measures as an additional output of the neural network to
the recently introduced pure displacement formulation[2].

## Installation
This code requires an [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) environment with a recent Python version.
The complete repository can be cloned and installed locally. It is recommended to create a conda environment before installation. This can be done by the following the command line instructions

```
$ git clone https://github.com/FuhgJan/mixedDEM.git ./mixedDEM
$ cd mixedDEM
$ conda env create -f environment.yml
$ conda activate mixedDEM
```
The provided example can then be run with

```
$ python3 run_hole_problem.py
```

Outputs will be written to mixedDEM/outputs/vtk_files/ and can be opened with paraview.

The conda environment can be closed with
```
$ conda deactivate
```
